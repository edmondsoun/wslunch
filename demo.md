WEDNESDAY SUBSYSTEM FOR LUNCH :]

At the beginning:
If anyone has broad questions, we can touch on those at the end.

"This is the way we've had you set up WSL so you can work with our
curriculum effectively; there's way more here, but it's not necessary for now
and a staff member will help you if you do run into something that requires
extension etc."

Show of hands:
- Who has used Linux?
- Who knows what a virtual machine is?

-> Talk briefly about WSL as a virtual machine/translation layer
-> Talk about the relationship of Ubuntu to WSL
--> Linux is a type of OS; Ubuntu is a particular "distro" of Linux
    (Redhat, Debian)

-> Talk about different *file systems*
--> Linux has its own file system; Windows has its own file system.
--> They are connected at the root (/)

> Moving things into Ubuntu

-> Encourage students to use terminal, not GUI
-> Why: speed & to avoid issues with wrong versions of software
    (Windows is a bus stop; don't get off the bus)
-> @Sarah: show file tree
-> (Explicitly don't show them drag and drop)

> Zippings/unzipping (ZoneIdentifier)
-> Don't unzip on the Windows side!
    -> You'll end up with a million ZoneIdenifiers (not dangerous; just annoying)
    -> You'll learn a cool shell command
-> Literally just `zip` / `unzip`
    -> We ALSO have secret easter egg `zipsubmit`

> Deleting things
-> Same old command `rm -rf <dirname>`

> LiveServer
-> You can't use liveserver how we have had you set up WSL.
-> That's intentional; we want you to use other server tools that we will show you.
    (**Double check that http.server hot reloads.)

> VSCode Terminal
-> Might start in Powershell.
-> Ideally should start Ubuntu shell (if you open from Ubuntu side; there is still weirdness here)
-> We will encourage EVERYONE to use the standalone shell; get in that habit now
instead of worrying about the VS Code terminal.


> TODO:
@sarah: put things into Rithm slides w/ visuals
@edmond: collect Joel notes & make private doc w/ extra info (meta)
